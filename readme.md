# Constraint types support

Comparison table

See [the table](./table.md).
This includes a list of constraint types as defined by [Hartmann et al.](https://doi.org/10.5445/ir/1000054062).
The table is updated to take into account the latest advancements of [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/),
and includes the results of [Validatrr](https://idlabresearch.github.io/validatrr/).

Pull requests to improve on the coverage is encouraged!

## TODO

Update [ShEx](http://shex.io/) to the latest version.
